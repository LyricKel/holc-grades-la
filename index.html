    <h2>Histories of Exclusion in Boyle Heights</h2>
    <p>
     But before we talk about Boyle Heights, Los Angeles as a whole has a lot to reckon with. 
    </p>
    <h3 content="color=red">
     Redlining.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Back in the 1920s and 30s, the Home Owners Loan Corporation - a national entity - decided what areas were considered the "best" for financial backing. In doing so, they decided who was worthy of loans.
      This went along racial lines and led to the lack of financial backing for all communities of color. So this is not specific to LA, but instead a national disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each neighborhood or section graded, there would be a write up report. They had details of who lived in the area, based on their race. They looked like <a href="https://cdn.glitch.com/2534e6ef-4db0-46e8-9095-b7557c9ccd4c%2F3.jpg?1519881447986" target="_blank">this</a>.
      They called out specific ethnic groups and explicitly stated that it would be "dangerous" to invest in an area due to the color of the residnets skin.

      These kinds of restrictions are still seen today in predatory lending practices from banks. 
      Some houses in California still have racial covenants written into their deeds. The <a href="https://www.kcet.org/shows/city-rising"><b><i>City Rising</i></b></a> series does a great job of covering these histories throughout California.
      It also covers other ways in which California has gotten itself into a housing crisis.

      Here is a map of an area in Los Angeles, specifically a neighborhood called Boyle Heights, where the old HOLC maps are laid over a needs map that shows a metric for needs of deep affordable housing by census tract.
      If you click on a census tract, some information will pop up about it.
